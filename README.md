# Surface-tension_Oscillating-droplets
Comsol files for symmetrical and asymmetrical oscillating droplets in 2D and 3D

This repository includes three Comsol Multiphysics 5.6 files. Each file includes a variation of the droplets simulated for the associated paper. There are 2 files with a three-dimensional setup and 1 file with a 2 dimensional set up. The physics principles employed in both 3D and 2D scenarios are identical. Please note that the files do not include the actual solutions, but they are set up and ready to be run for further analysis.

The defined parameters for the study can be seen under *Parameters*.
